## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- CSS Modules used for keyframe animations

### What I learned

- I refreshed and deepened my knowledge in testing React apps using Jest and react-testing-library (RTL)
- I learned how to setup Jest and RTL for TypeScript
- I finally applied basics of keyframe animations

### Useful resources

- [Net Ninja - Integration Tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wbnwsKrnYU&t=875s) - This video helped me with writing better tests
- [React - The Complete Guide by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux) - Overall great course but I used it for learning how to test React applications in this project
